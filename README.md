SpaceY Rocket Landing Prediction Project

This project seeks to help SpaceY compete with SpaceX by predicting successful landings of the first stage of its rockets, which could reduce the costs of each mission by reusing expensive components. Using data from the SpaceX public API and Wikipedia page, we developed a machine learning model to predict whether a launch will have a successful landing.

The goal is to develop a classification model that predicts whether the first stage of a launch will land successfully. This will allow SpaceY to optimize its resources and reduce costs by deciding whether it is feasible to reuse the first stage of its rockets. We use data analysis techniques and machine learning models to predict landing success.

Methodology
Data Collection:
Data obtained from SpaceX API and Wikipedia.
Data Preparation:
Cleaning data and classifying landings as successful or unsuccessful.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore and visualize patterns using SQL and charts.
Interactive Visual Analysis:
Visualizations with Folium and an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash.
Predictive Modeling:
Construction and optimization of classification models with GridSearchCV.
